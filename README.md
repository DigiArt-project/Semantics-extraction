# Semantic Extraction

**Disclaimer** : this is a research code, so it may not to be well organized and some optimizations are needed.

## Overview
=======
There are three folders.

* Tools
* Interactive Learning
* Visual Search iOS
* make database annotation

In each folder, you will find a README which will explain deeper the functionality. 

### 1. Tools

In this package, you fill find several necessary tools useful for performing Interactive Learning.

For example : compute descriptors, compute views of 3D objects, generate KD-Tree Index for similarity search...

### 2. Interactive Learning

This is the code for Interactive Learning. Works only on Desktop for now.

### 3. Visual Search iOS

This is the code for the iOS App on iPad. It allows to capture 3D data and then to perform Similarity Search or SVM using the Structure Sensor Dataset.

### 4. Make database annotation

This is the code for the iOs App on iPad which
