    // Sadly, iOS 9.2+ introduced unexpected behavior: every time a Structure Sensor is plugged in to iOS, iOS will launch all Structure-related apps in the background.
    // The apps will not be visible to the user.
    // This can cause problems since Structure SDK apps typically ask the user for permission to use the camera when launched.
    // This leads to the user's first experience with a Structure SDK app being:
    //     1.  Download Structure SDK apps from App Store.
    //     2.  Plug in Structure Sensor to iPad.
    //     3.  Get bombarded with "X app wants to use the Camera" notifications from every installed Structure SDK app.
    // Each app has to deal with this problem in its own way.
    // In the Structure SDK, sample apps peacefully exit without causing a crash report.
    // This also has other benefits, such as not using memory.
    // Note that Structure SDK does not support connecting to Structure Sensor if the app is in the background.
